I am a third year PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. My research interests primarily include dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) and Bayesian methods and I am currently supervised by Dr. Olli Saarela and Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum.

Following my first year of PhD studies, I joined [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/en/stable/) as a Google Summer of Code student where I worked on developing a Dirichlet Process submodule; this is still work on progress. Following my second year, I dove deeper into PyMC's computational backend and worked on [AePPL](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl), an Aesara-based packaged that can derive log-likelihood expressions from random graphs that represent a data-generating mechanism.

I am also part of the [Health Data Working Group](https://health-data-working-group.github.io/) and, as of October 2021, I am also happy to serve as a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/larryshamalama/). As of November 2022, I am delighted to have become a core developper of PyMC.

Prior to my PhD studies, I have pursued a dual Master's degree: one in biostatistics at McGill University and one in Public Health at the University of Bordeaux. I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Erica Moodie](https://www.ericamoodie.com/) and [Dr. Rodolphe Thiébaut](https://www.bordeaux-population-health.center/profile/rodolphe-thiebaut/), both of whom I look up to greatly and attribute a lot of my personal and professional growth.

In my free time, I enjoy coding in Python, skateboarding and eating copious amounts of fruit (especially grapes, bananas, oranges and watermelon). Feel free to connect with me! Tu peux aussi m'écrire en français :)
