Dirichlet Processes (DP) are a Bayesian nonparametric method that can serve as prior distributions for distribution themselves. (Omitting some technical details) There are many possible "schemas" and an interesting one is called the stick-breaking process where DPs can be represented as an infinite sum which, if approximated by a finite sum, will have weights following a generalized dirichlet distribution.
