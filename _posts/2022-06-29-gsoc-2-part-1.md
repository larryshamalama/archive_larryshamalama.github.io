description: Another summer of code!
---

Following my first GSoC, I had such a great experience with the PyMC community that I decided to under a second summer of code!

## My Project

Last year, my project entailed adding a Dirichlet Process (DP) submodule to PyMC. It's still a work-in-progress, but hopefully I will have something working by the end of the summer in [PyMC experimental](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-experimental)! In January, I was able to merge a distribution classes for weights obtained via a stick-breaking process; you can read about the process in [this blogpost](https://larrydong.com/gsoc/stickbreakingweights/).

A major focal point of my 2022 GSoC project revolves around improving AePPL's functionality for mixture models. Notably, I aim to address the following issues:

- [Support mixture graphs defined by `switch`](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl/issues/77);
- [Support mixture graphs defined by `ifelse`](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl/issues/76);
- [Extend mixture functionality for multivariate components](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aeppl/issues/106).

Following my first summer, I decided that it would be good to further invest time diving into a codebase where I know that I need to help to understand. Given that I needed a break from my PhD studies, this time investment into a theoretically challenging project was something that appealed to me but also a good investment for the longer-term, both on a personal and professional level. Aesara, the computational backend to PyMC, is not an easy package to wrap one's head around. Its use is non-trivial and its codebase daunting. On top of this, AePPL provides the log-probability of random graphs written in Aesara and the delineation in package differences is not obvious. As my first blogpost for this summer's GSoC, it would be good to talk a bit about Aesara and AePPL.
